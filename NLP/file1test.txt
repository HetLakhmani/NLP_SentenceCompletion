The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A stitch in time saves nine.
All's well that ends well.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
As you sow, so shall you reap.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Better late than never.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Don't cry over spilled milk.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
